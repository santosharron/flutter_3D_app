To create a 3D ecommerce app in Flutter using three.js, you will need to set up a Flutter development environment, familiarize yourself with three.js, plan the layout and features of your app, design and create 3D models of your products, integrate three.js into your Flutter app, implement the features and functionality of your app, test and debug your app, and deploy it for users to access. This will require knowledge of web development, 3D graphics, and the Flutter framework.
